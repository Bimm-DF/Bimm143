>Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their 
corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes. 

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```
```{r}
nrow(expr)
```
```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```


>Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative 
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the 
expression of ORMDL3? 


```{r}
ggplot(expr)+ aes(x=geno, exp, fill=geno) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE)
```
